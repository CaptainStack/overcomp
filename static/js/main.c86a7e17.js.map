For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\r\n\t   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\r\n\t   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\r\n\t   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\r\n\t   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\r\n\t   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\r\n\t   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\r\n\t   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\r\n\t   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\r\n\t   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\r\n\t   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\r\n\t   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\r\n\t   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\r\n\t   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\r\n\t   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\r\n\t   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\r\n\t   *     }\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\r\n\t   *\r\n\t   */\r\n\t  function is(valueA, valueB) {\r\n\t    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\r\n\t      return true;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\r\n\t      return false;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\r\n\t        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\r\n\t      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\r\n\t      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\r\n\t      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\r\n\t        return true;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\r\n\t        return false;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\r\n\t        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\r\n\t        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\r\n\t      return true;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t    return false;\r\n\t  }\r\n\t\r\n\t  function deepEqual(a, b) {\r\n\t    if (a === b) {\r\n\t      return true;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t    if (\r\n\t      !isIterable(b) ||\r\n\t      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\r\n\t      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\r\n\t      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\r\n\t      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\r\n\t      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\r\n\t    ) {\r\n\t      return false;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\r\n\t      return true;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\r\n\t\r\n\t    if (isOrdered(a)) {\r\n\t      var entries = a.entries();\r\n\t      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\r\n\t        var entry = entries.next().value;\r\n\t        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\r\n\t      }) && entries.next().done;\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t    var flipped = false;\r\n\t\r\n\t    if (a.size === undefined) {\r\n\t      if (b.size === undefined) {\r\n\t        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\r\n\t          a.cacheResult();\r\n\t        }\r\n\t      } else {\r\n\t        flipped = true;\r\n\t        var _ = a;\r\n\t        a = b;\r\n\t        b = _;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    }\r\n\t\r\n\t    var allEqual = true;\r\n\t    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\r\n\t      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\r\n\t          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\r\n\t        allEqual = false;\r\n\t        return false;\r\n\t      }\r\n\t    });\r\n\t\r\n\t    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\r\n\t  }\r\n\t\r\n\t  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\r\n\t\r\n\t    function Repeat(value, times) {\r\n\t      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\r\n\t        return new Repeat(value, times);\r\n\t      }\r\n\t      this._value = value;\r\n\t      this.size = times === undefined ?

For example, `Date` represents a value by returning a unix\r\n   * timestamp for `valueOf`:\r\n   *\r\n   *     var date1 = new Date(1234567890000); // Fri Feb 13 2009 ...\r\n   *     var date2 = new Date(1234567890000);\r\n   *     date1.valueOf(); // 1234567890000\r\n   *     assert( date1 !== date2 );\r\n   *     assert( Immutable.is( date1, date2 ) );\r\n   *\r\n   * Note: overriding `valueOf` may have other implications if you use this object\r\n   * where JavaScript expects a primitive, such as implicit string coercion.\r\n   *\r\n   * For more complex types, especially collections, implementing `valueOf` may\r\n   * not be performant. An alternative is to implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\r\n   *\r\n   * `equals` takes another object, presumably of similar type, and returns true\r\n   * if the it is equal. Equality is symmetrical, so the same result should be\r\n   * returned if this and the argument are flipped.\r\n   *\r\n   *     assert( a.equals(b) === b.equals(a) );\r\n   *\r\n   * `hashCode` returns a 32bit integer number representing the object which will\r\n   * be used to determine how to store the value object in a Map or Set. You must\r\n   * provide both or neither methods, one must not exist without the other.\r\n   *\r\n   * Also, an important relationship between these methods must be upheld: if two\r\n   * values are equal, they *must* return the same hashCode. If the values are not\r\n   * equal, they might have the same hashCode; this is called a hash collision,\r\n   * and while undesirable for performance reasons, it is acceptable.\r\n   *\r\n   *     if (a.equals(b)) {\r\n   *       assert( a.hashCode() === b.hashCode() );\r\n   *     }\r\n   *\r\n   * All Immutable collections implement `equals` and `hashCode`.\r\n   *\r\n   */\r\n  function is(valueA, valueB) {\r\n    if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    if (!valueA || !valueB) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n    if (typeof valueA.valueOf === 'function' &&\r\n        typeof valueB.valueOf === 'function') {\r\n      valueA = valueA.valueOf();\r\n      valueB = valueB.valueOf();\r\n      if (valueA === valueB || (valueA !== valueA && valueB !== valueB)) {\r\n        return true;\r\n      }\r\n      if (!valueA || !valueB) {\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    if (typeof valueA.equals === 'function' &&\r\n        typeof valueB.equals === 'function' &&\r\n        valueA.equals(valueB)) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n    return false;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  function deepEqual(a, b) {\r\n    if (a === b) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (\r\n      !isIterable(b) ||\r\n      a.size !== undefined && b.size !== undefined && a.size !== b.size ||\r\n      a.__hash !== undefined && b.__hash !== undefined && a.__hash !== b.__hash ||\r\n      isKeyed(a) !== isKeyed(b) ||\r\n      isIndexed(a) !== isIndexed(b) ||\r\n      isOrdered(a) !== isOrdered(b)\r\n    ) {\r\n      return false;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if (a.size === 0 && b.size === 0) {\r\n      return true;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var notAssociative = !isAssociative(a);\r\n\r\n    if (isOrdered(a)) {\r\n      var entries = a.entries();\r\n      return b.every(function(v, k)  {\r\n        var entry = entries.next().value;\r\n        return entry && is(entry[1], v) && (notAssociative || is(entry[0], k));\r\n      }) && entries.next().done;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var flipped = false;\r\n\r\n    if (a.size === undefined) {\r\n      if (b.size === undefined) {\r\n        if (typeof a.cacheResult === 'function') {\r\n          a.cacheResult();\r\n        }\r\n      } else {\r\n        flipped = true;\r\n        var _ = a;\r\n        a = b;\r\n        b = _;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    var allEqual = true;\r\n    var bSize = b.__iterate(function(v, k)  {\r\n      if (notAssociative ? !a.has(v) :\r\n          flipped ? !is(v, a.get(k, NOT_SET)) : !is(a.get(k, NOT_SET), v)) {\r\n        allEqual = false;\r\n        return false;\r\n      }\r\n    });\r\n\r\n    return allEqual && a.size === bSize;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  createClass(Repeat, IndexedSeq);\r\n\r\n    function Repeat(value, times) {\r\n      if (!(this instanceof Repeat)) {\r\n        return new Repeat(value, times);\r\n      }\r\n      this._value = value;\r\n      this.size = times === undefined ?
